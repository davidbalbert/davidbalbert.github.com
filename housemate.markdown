title: Looking for a housemate
---

I'm looking for a housemate to live in the smaller of the two bedrooms in my beautiful apartment in Carroll Gardens.

**The overview**

- Carroll Street between Smith and Hoyt. Half a block from the Carroll St F/G station.
- Third floor walk-up in a brownstone on a picturesque block. Convenient to everything.
- Two bedroom, one bath. Large living room and kitchen.
- There's an extra room that we currently use for bikes which has tons of closet space. These closets are yours to use.
- $1,300/month (I pay $1,400 for the larger bedroom). First and last month due when you move in. Our landlord is raising the rent in August, but I'll eat the increase until next June to guarantee that your rent stays at $1,300 for a full year. After that, we'll split the increase proportionally.
- June 1st move in.

**Your room**

Let's start with the bad news: it's pretty small: 6' by 11'. It comfortably fits a full bed, but not much else. Its location in the apartment (directly off the living room) also makes it a bit less private than you might like. That said, it's been my room for the past five and a half years and I've been very comfortable.

Now the good news, and there's a lot of it: the room has a ton of shelving built into the wall as well as a closet behind the bed. No need for a dresser. It also has a large east facing window. You get sunlight in your room every morning (there's a shade to keep it out when you need), and you have a view all the way to Prospect Park, 1.4 miles away. It's breathtaking.

**The apartment**

There's basically nothing bad about the apartment besides wear and tear due to its age. Every room with the exception of the bike room has windows. The kitchen is huge and beautiful, with windows on three sides and tons of sunlight. The living room is spacious, and the bathroom, while on the small side, is well lit, has a great view, and has a number of nice touches including a clawfoot tub.

The apartment will come only partially furnished: the TV, couch, and credenza in the living room, among other things, belong to my current housemates. The kitchen table is mine. You're welcome to bring your own furniture or we can purchase some things together. You'll need your own bed as well.

I've been living in the apartment for five and a half years and have a good relationship with the landlord.

Because your room is substantially smaller than mine, I'll give you primary custody of the living room when you're around. This is the same arrangement I have with my current housemates, and it has worked out well.

I only cook occasionally, which means you basically have the run of the kitchen. No promises that things will always be this way, but if my past behavior is any indication, you shouldn't be worried that I'll suddenly start cooking every night. I do hang out in the kitchen a lot because it's a great room.

**The neighborhood**

Smith and Court Streets have tons of restaurants and bars. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to Whole Foods from our apartment. Carroll Park is around the corner and the Carroll Gardens Greenmarket is too. There are also bodegas, butchers, a pharmacy, and laundromats within walking distance (no washing machine in our apartment, sadly). Living on the F and the G gives you a one seat ride to both Manhattan and North Brooklyn, and the Carroll Street station is literally around the corner.

**About me**

My name is David, but I go by Dave. I'm a 30 year old computer programmer and small business owner. I run a writers retreat for programmers heavily based on unschooling. If you want to talk about weird educational ideas, we can definitely do that. I'm also an amateur pianist and aspiring playwright. Don't worry: I'll practice with headphones when you're around. I'm clean and I don't smoke. Pet peeves: a dirty kitchen, stuff in the sink, cabinets left open. I don't have people over often, but I'm not opposed to it every once and a while.

**About you**

Kind, considerate, and able to communicate directly and frankly rather than bottling up your frustrations until they boil over. Clean, non-smoker who's on the quiet side. Whatever your race, gender, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs, I'm excited to meet you.

<a href="mailto:davidbalbert+housemate@gmail.com?subject=Carroll Gardens apartment">Email me</a> with some information introducing yourself, and we can set up a time for you to see the apartment and for us to get to know each other.

**Miscellaneous**

- No pets :(. I'm allergic.
- Utilities are split 50/50. Over the past four months, this ranged from $64 to $76.
- You can pay by check, Venmo, etc.
- I'm happy to split the cost of a housekeeper.
