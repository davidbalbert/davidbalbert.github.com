<p>So I need a project. I mean, I really don&#8217;t need a project. I have a lot on my plate including a <a href="http://android.chazy.dk/">mobile phone virtualization</a> project on top of <a href="http://source.android.com/">Android</a> which I&#8217;m quite a bit behind on (more on that at a later date), but I still feel like I need a project. I want to learn board layout, which is something that isn&#8217;t really taught in school. It&#8217;s a shame that it isn&#8217;t because the more and more I think about it, I realize I didn&#8217;t become a Computer Engineer to learn how to design components, but to learn how to use them.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>What I&#8217;d really like to do is design an <abbr>arm</abbr> board and get Linux running on it. Unfortunately, I think if I tried this now, I would never get it done. I don&#8217;t even think I&#8217;d know where to start. What I need to do is start smaller. I&#8217;ve always wanted one of those <abbr>lcd</abbr> dot matrix scrolls that are used to advertise the lotto jackpot, but even that might be a bit too much for the first project. What I&#8217;d like to do is start with only one of the display segments &ndash; the kind that can fit one letter &ndash; and work my way up from there. Here are my requirements:</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
<li><abbr>avr</abbr> based</li>
<li>Persistent storage</li>
<li>Programmable over serial</li>
<li>Can do multi-frame animation</li>
<li>Looks totally cool</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s really about it. If I can get one segment up and running, it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to get a bunch running in tandem, and from there, its off to the races. I&#8217;m going to try to get a bill of materials up by next week, but these things have a habit of falling behind, especially when I&#8217;m not getting a grade.</p>

<h2>The Questions</h2>

<p>I really don&#8217;t know what to expect, so if you&#8217;ve had any experience with anything like this, drop me a line and tell me all the things that I&#8217;m going to screw up before I actually do it. Also, this project needs a kick ass name. Give me your suggestions.</p>
