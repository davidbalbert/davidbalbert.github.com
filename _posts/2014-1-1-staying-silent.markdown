title: Staying Silent
---

About five years ago, when I was still in college, a friend of mine invited me to go to an LGBT rights event. I've forgotten what the event was, but it was something large like a protest rally or the Pride parade. I said "no," and I still regret that decision.

I remember being afraid that if I went to the event, someone might think I was gay. I'm embarrassed that this once bothered me and even more embarrassed that it kept me from fighting for what I knew was right.

So much progress has been made on LGBT rights in the past five years, and through it all, I've remained silent. I haven't hidden my beliefs, but I haven't been vocal about them either. I'm not going to stay silent any more. Not just about LGBT rights, but about all forms of injustice.

I'm not doing this because I think that my voice alone is important. It has taken all sorts of rabble rousers to change our collective attitude towards LGBT rights, and there's still a long way to go before LGBT people are truly treated equally in society. I'm speaking out because the world doesn't get changed by a bunch of silent, but well meaning people.

Here's to a more just 2014.
